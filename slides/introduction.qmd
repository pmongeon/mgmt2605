## Agenda

-   What is scholarly communication?
-   What are bibliometrics?
-   Overview of the course and assignments

## What are scholarly communications?

"The system through which research and other scholarly writings are created, evaluated for quality, disseminated to the scholarly community, and preserved for future use" (Association of College & Research Libraries, 2003).

## The scholarly publishing cycle

## What are bibliometrics?

-   "The measurement of all aspects related to the publication and reading of books and documents." (Otlet, 1934)

-   "the application of mathematics and statistical methods to books and other media of communication." (Pritchard, 1969)

In principle, bibliometrics could be applied to any type of documents, but in practice they are applied to scholarly outputs to **measure knowledge production, dissemination, and use**

## What's in a name?

Bibliometrics is a widely used term to refer to the field, but it is not the only (and probably not the best) one. Other (quasi-)synonyms include:

-   Bibliometrics, Scientometrics, info(r)metrics, altmetrics, Quantitative Science Studies

-   Science of science, research on research

Science and technology studies (STS) shares an object but uses mainly qualitative methods.

## Two underlying assumptions of bibliometrics

-   Peer-reviewed scholarly work are contributions to the advancement of knowledge (or units of knowledge production)

-   Because researchers cite their sources, citations can measure of the use (or impact? Quality? Importance?) of a contribution to knowledge.

## Applications of bibliometrics

-   Sociology of science

-   History of science

-   Science policy

-   Library and Information Science

-   Research evaluation

-   Etc.

## The course in three parts

-   Understanding the research system

    -   Theoretical with lectures and in-class discussions

-   Analyzing and evaluating research

    -   Practical, with a focus on hands-on work with data

-   Improving the research system

    -   Critical, with a focus on some of the main contemporary issues in academia

## Assignments

1.  Article review (15% - Sep 30)
2.  Outline of a research project (5% - Oct 28)
3.  Descriptive analysis of a research network (10% - Nov 18)
4.  Research assessment report (30% - Dec 2)
5.  Research project (30% - Dec 16)

## How to use your time (week 1-3)

-   explore literature in the bibliometrics field and complete assignment 1.

-   Get a sense of what the field is about, the types of questions we ask and methods we use.

-   Start thinking about what interests you most and about topics for the research project.
